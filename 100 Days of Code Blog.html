      <h1>The Journey to Coding</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Most people never get past their first 100 days of learning to code. I'm trying!</p> 
      <h2>How This Works</h2>
      <p>This blog that charts my first steps, links I liked, and how I felt. When you feel stuck, I hope it helps you move along more quickly</p>

      <h3> Who I am</h3>
      <img src="download-4.jpg" width="200" height="200"/>
      <p>In 2020, I joined <a href="hackclub.com" target="_blank">Hack Club</a>, a nonprofit that helps high schoolers start after-school computer clubs. My job was Chief Operating Officer, which means I work directly with <a href=https://twitter.com/zachlatta">the founder</a>. When hired, I was the only non-technical person on the team. In fact, I didn't even know what HTML was. Often, in working with others, I couldn't understand what they were saying.</p>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>Growing up in the 1980s, no one had computers or the internet.
      <em> Here I am on the right. It's my senior year in high school in the 1990s, and I've never even seen a computer yet:</em></p>

      <p>Today, fewer than .5% of the human population can code. Fewer than half of schools even try to teach any tech.</p>
      <h3>My Goals</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Deeply understand computers and the internet</li>
          <li>Chronicle what it helps me do</li>
          <li>Share so others can do the same.</li></ol>

    <h2>DAY 1</h2>
    <p>
    <strong>April 30th, 2020. 6am.--</strong> Today marks the day I asked my 1st question on Hack Club slack, hence announcing my intention to learn to code. 
    <em>background</em>
    In 2019 I built my first html website after meeting Hack Club founder and feeling curious about coding. I went through Hack Club's <a href="https://workshops.hackclub.com/personal_website/"> How to Build a Personal Website workshop</a> on Hack Club's website. Had zero idea what I was doing. Felt terrified. Didn't know what html was; how the internet started. Who built all this internet infrastructure???? I needed context and love reading so fortunately one afternoon at Barnes and Nobles I purchased <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Hackers-Geniuses-Created-Revolution/dp/1476708703"> "The Innovators"</a>, a nonfiction book that tells the story of the people behind the computer/internet. That helped a lot. Suddenly, I saw the internet not as something from space, but rather as the result of humans building and experimenting over hundreds of years. Following Hack Club's tutorial, I build a website in <a href="https://repl.it/~">repl.it</a> but then I gave up and did other things for a year. Felt like i couldnâ€™t do it. Or worried it would take to long.</p>
    <p> Back to April 2020. My motivation returned because I began working fulltime at Hack Club and needed to understand coding. But also because I was making lots of friends who were passionate about coding. Still, I didn't know how to get started</p>
