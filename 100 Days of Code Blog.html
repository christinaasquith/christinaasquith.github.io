      <h1 class="name">The Journey to Coding</h1>
      <h2 class="name">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Most people never get past their first 100 days of learning to code. I'm trying!</p> 
      <h2 class="name">How This Works</h2>
      <p>This blog that charts my first steps, links I liked, and how I felt. When you feel stuck, I hope it helps you move along more quickly</p>

      <h3> Who I am</h3>
      <img src="download-4.jpg" width="200" height="200"/>
      <p>In 2020, I joined <a href="hackclub.com" target="_blank">Hack Club</a>, a nonprofit that helps high schoolers start after-school computer clubs. My job is Chief Operating Officer, which means I work directly with <a href=https://twitter.com/zachlatta">the founder</a>. When hired, I was the only non-technical person on the team. In fact, I didn't even know what HTML was. Often, in working with others, I couldn't understand what they were saying.</p>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>Growing up in the early 1990s, no one in my NJ town had computers or  internet access. The school tech club was all boys.  I never learned even how to type.

      </div>
      <p>Today, fewer than .5% of the human population can code. Fewer than half of schools even try to teach any tech.</p>
      <h3>My Goals</h3>
      </center>
        <ol>
          <li>Deeply understand computers and the internet</li>
          <li>Learn to code so I can build and do more amazing stuff</li>
          <li>Chronicle my learning journey</li>
          <li>Share so others can do the same.</li>
        </ol>

          <h3><strong>Can I do it?</strong> Let's go!</h3></br>
       </p>
    </center>

<h2 class="name">Beginner Goals</h2>
<p>Here are the most important things I learned in the first 3-4 months of becoming technical. Codecademy supported me in learning html/css basics, but Hack Club helped me learn the rest </P>
<ul>
<li>Understand that technology is just a tool and how real programmers think/talk/use tech</li>

<li>Understand how to use Repl.it/or VS Code</li>

<li>Learn HTML basics</li>
<li>Learn basics of styling w CSS</li>  
<li>Learn how to be self-taught  (how to use Google/YouTube/GitHub/Hack Club Slack and workshops)</li>
<li>Learn the landscape: history of computers/ operating systems / servers/ folders / browsers/the internet.</li>
<li>Learn basics of GitHub and how to commit and push but also WHY use GitHub?</li>
<li>Learn how to create a domain name for myself, link my code to it, update my code, and then build out new sites on my domain</li>
<li>Begin to understand what else I could learn, ie other languages</li>
</ul>

    <h2 class="name">Early 2019</h2>
In 2019 I built my first html website after meeting Hack Club founder and feeling curious about coding. I went through Hack Club's <a href="https://workshops.hackclub.com/personal_website/"> How to Build a Personal Website workshop</a> on Hack Club's website. Had zero idea what I was doing. Didn't know what html was; how the internet started. Who built all this internet infrastructure???? I needed context and love reading so fortunately one afternoon at Barnes and Nobles I purchased <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Hackers-Geniuses-Created-Revolution/dp/1476708703"> "The Innovators"</a>, a nonfiction book that tells the story of the people behind the computer/internet.  Suddenly, I saw the internet not as something from space, but rather as the result of humans building and experimenting over hundreds of years. </p>
<p>Following Hack Club's tutorial, I build a website in <a href="https://repl.it/~">repl.it</a> but then I gave up and did other things for a year. Felt like i couldn’t do it. Or worried it would take to long. Forgot about it.</p>


   <h2 class="name">Spring 2020</h2>
   <p>Decide I want to give coding another try</p>
    <h3>April</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Asked my 1st question on Hack Club slack</li>
   <li>Joined Codeacademy.com and pay like $14/month.</li> 
   <li>Working my way through the HTML class in Codeacademy. It's at least a month long course, and it's filling in the gaps for me.</li></ul>

    <h3>May</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Signed up for GitHub. I have no idea what it is</li>
      <li>Bought a domain name at Google. Friends from Hackclub.com help me every day with questions, or I would have gotten very stuck</li>
    <li>Finished the intro on HTML from Code Academy and started my own websites with span, line breaks, italics, bold and unordered lists</li>
    <li>It's May 22nd and I earned a "badge" at Codeacademy but i'm only 4% into my htm lesson. UGH. That took me two days. I'm taking their tutorials and applying what I learn on my personal repl.it site and that's been great. I'm practicing styling tags inside html and hrefs to add hyperlinks. I  just went to hack club slack to see if someone could recommend how to build a blog. Some people are recommending <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekllrb</a> and <a href="https://dev.to/connecting-with-stackbit" target="_blank">another site</a> But honestly I don't know how to build those into my code. 
      
      <p>It's so great to have Sam in Singapore bc someone is always awake, but that advice is too far advanced for me. So I guess a cool goal would be to figure out how to get that into my code. Hack Club is great for support when I get stuck, but it's not a place to fully learn how to code.  Both those are really valuable though. Also, i want to ship this, but I don’t know if I should ship my repl.it link, my github link or connect it to christina.cool and ship that. I have to get my personal site together…. I wish i had the whole day to code- its so exciting. </p>
    </li>
    </ul>

    <p>May 24th</p>
      <p>Loving going thru codeacademy while simultaneously building my site. This morn I created tab links at the top of my site that will allow me to click on them and go somewhere else on the site.</p>

      <div id="top10">Christina's top 10</h2>
      Still hitting questions, like my push to github isn’t uploading my active website. I slacked my expert friend w this question. Without that, not sure how I would have figured it out.  Also, my daughter and i posted on our town listserve that we’d build you a website for $50, and we got a client. Having this pressure will be awesome.
      
      <p>Still struggling w divs but adding them to my site. My main worry atm is how will i remember all this. When will it become second nature. Also, my code is getting so long-- i’m struggling to not feel overwhelmed by it. </p>
      <p>Do you ever want to just code all day? It’s kind of addictive! </p>

    <h3>June </h3><i>More updates coming soon! I am busy learning to code atm</i>
<h2 class="name"> Summer 2020</h2>
<h3>July</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Joined <a href=https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/ target="_blank">  Hack Club's Summer of Making </a> program which has been fun, and I'm coding every day.</li>
    <li> Set as my Summer of Making goal as learning some Javascript</li>
<li>Made this website public.</li>  
<li>continuing Codecademy course. I'm 53% finished with HTML beginners course</li>
<li>Practicing styling my CSS, including lists, tables and forms</li> 
<img src="unordered lists.jpg" width="180" height="180"/> 
<li>Moved to Visual Studio Code from Repl.it.  This was not easy, and I had a lot of support from my friends at Hack Club. This is a more advanced coding editor, and there were a couple days of frustration as I learned a new system, but using the same tools as professional developers is pretty great.</li>
<li>Built <a href=https://christina.cool/parents/ target="blank"> christina.cool/parents </a> This was a way to implement some stuff I'd learned in codecademy, including Divs and Tables. Shared it w friends. This is the first "real" thing I've built and while it's not useful, it's really important to have the confidence to build and share projects as a way to push myself to keep going. Sharing publicly matters a lot. On the ship </li>

<li>Built a fundraiser presentation for a donor and got live advice from a talented webdesigner (Lachlan) that pushed me. I also learned to 2 things: two use Hack Club's font, and to pull the colors and a graphic from another website and put it in my own. 
  I also shared the website on a call with colleagues at Hack Club, which was fantastic. Having a community to share the milestone moments of coding is really important. Presenting that made me feel amazing, and motivated me to keep going. This was a private fundraising doc, so I can't share it :(  </li>


<li>Watched a Hack Club ama presentation with Dylan Field, founder of Figma, and saw a bunch of students using Figma, which inspired an idea in me that one day i could create my own designs for my sites, and not rely on others images existing on website. This is unlocking a creativity in me that I'm excited to explore. </li>
</ul>

<h3>August</h3>
<p>I'm coming to the end of my self-described "beginners' stage and I'm testing that I can apply my knowledge and finding some gaps. Overall, my emotional state is excited: I feel encouraged that I'm learning because I know now how to build and publish websites for the world to see, and I see very clearly what I've learned (html basics plus a little styling) and I see the next stages of my learning, which is tables and forms and more styling like how to publish photos. When I look at basic website code, I understand it. once I master this, I'll move onto javascript-- there, I'm excited to start working with databases. </p>
<p>Couple additional points: there are </p>
