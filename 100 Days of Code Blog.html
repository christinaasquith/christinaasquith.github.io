      <h1 class="name">The Journey to Coding</h1>
      <h2 class="name">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Most people never get past their first 100 days of learning to code. I'm trying!</p> 
      <h2 class="name">How This Works</h2>
      <p>This blog that charts my first steps, links I liked, and how I felt. When you feel stuck, I hope it helps you move along more quickly</p>

      <h3> Who I am</h3>
      <img src="download-4.jpg" width="200" height="200"/>
      <p>In 2020, I joined <a href="hackclub.com" target="_blank">Hack Club</a>, a nonprofit that helps high schoolers start after-school computer clubs. My job is Chief Operating Officer, which means I work directly with <a href=https://twitter.com/zachlatta">the founder</a>. When hired, I was the only non-technical person on the team. In fact, I didn't even know what HTML was. Often, in working with others, I couldn't understand what they were saying.</p>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>Growing up in the early 1990s, no one had computers or the internet.
      <em> Here I am on the right. It's my senior year in high school, and I've never even seen a computer yet:</em></p>
      <img src="hschris.jpg" width="200" height="200"/>
      <p>Today, fewer than .5% of the human population can code. Fewer than half of schools even try to teach any tech.</p>
      <h3>My Goals</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Deeply understand computers and the internet</li>
          <li>Chronicle what it helps me do</li>
          <li>Share so others can do the same.</li></ol>
          <br>
       <h3><strong>Can I do it?</strong> Let's go!</h3></br>

    <h2 class="name">Early 2019</h2>
In 2019 I built my first html website after meeting Hack Club founder and feeling curious about coding. I went through Hack Club's <a href="https://workshops.hackclub.com/personal_website/"> How to Build a Personal Website workshop</a> on Hack Club's website. Had zero idea what I was doing. Felt terrified. Didn't know what html was; how the internet started. Who built all this internet infrastructure???? I needed context and love reading so fortunately one afternoon at Barnes and Nobles I purchased <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Hackers-Geniuses-Created-Revolution/dp/1476708703"> "The Innovators"</a>, a nonfiction book that tells the story of the people behind the computer/internet.  Suddenly, I saw the internet not as something from space, but rather as the result of humans building and experimenting over hundreds of years. </p>
<p>Following Hack Club's tutorial, I build a website in <a href="https://repl.it/~">repl.it</a> but then I gave up and did other things for a year. Felt like i couldnâ€™t do it. Or worried it would take to long. Forgot about it.</p>
   <h2 class="name">Spring 2020</h2>
   <p>Decide I want to give coding another try</p>
    <h3>April</h3><p><strong>April 30th, 2020. 6am.--</strong> Today marks the day I asked my 1st question on Hack Club slack, hence announcing my intention to learn to code. 
   
   <p><strong>April 2</strong> Joined Codeacademy.com and pay like $14/month.</p> 
    <p><strong>April, but later in the month</p></strong>
    <p>Working my way through the HTML class in Codeacademy. It's at least a month long course, and it's filling in the gaps for me.</P> 
    <h3>May</h3>
    <p>Signed up for GitHub. Bought this domain name at Google. Friends from Hackclub.com help me every day with questions, or I would have gotten very stuck</p> 
    <h3><p>JUNE: </h3><i>More updates coming soon! I am busy learning to code atm</i></p>
<h2 class="name"> Summer 2020</h2>
<h3>July</h3><p>Joined <a href=https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/ target="_blank">  Hack Club's Summer of Making </a> program which has been fun, and I'm coding every day. Set as my Summer of Making goal as learning some Javascript</>
<p>Made this website public.  Focused now on styling my CSS</P>
