        <p><center>Hi there! My name is Christina, and I'm Chief Operating Officer and board member of <a href=https://hackclub.com target="_blank">Hack Club,</a> a tech non-profit that is creating a new generation of coders and innovators.<br> 
          
          <p>I'm also founder of <strong><a href=https="//fullerproject.org/"" target="_blank">The Fuller Project</a></strong>, a global nonprofit journalism organization that investigates issues impacting women. 
           For 7 years, I ran Fuller Project as editor-in-chief, won awards and published in all the major outlets including the cover of TIME Magazine, and built out the team, and established an incredible roster of donors.<br></p>
          
          <p>My career includes reporting for The New York Times Boston Bureau, The Philadelphia Inquirer and Public Radio International, and editing pieces for The New Yorker, The Atlantic and CNN.  I've published thousands of articles as a newspaper journalist, non-fiction author &  Iraq war correspondent. I've lived in Baghdad, Istanbul, Santiago, Chile and London. I've spoken on BBC, ABC News, PRI's The World and National Public Radio. </p> <br>

        <p><i>This website is under construction. I'm building it as you read. (summer 2020)</p></i>
