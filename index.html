        <p><center>Hi! I'm Chief Operating Officer and board member of <b>Hack Club.</b><br> I also founded <strong><a href:https://fullerproject.org/ target="_blank">The Fuller Project</a></strong> and served as editor-in-chief for six years.<br> Before then, I was a full-time investigative journalist &  war correspondent.</p>
      
      <p>  At 19 years old I began reporting for The New York Times, and over my career, I've spoken on NPR, ABC News, BBC News, Al Jazeera and reported and edited for The New Yorker, The Atlantic, The Washington Post, Associated Press, CNN,and had a column in Foreign Policy Magazine. . .</p> 
        <p>Of the thousands of articles, radio segments and documentaries I've worked on, you'll find my favorite <a href="My Articles.html">here.</a>  In 2019, I came up with an idea to investigate underpaid women workers in the US, focusing on tens of thousands of US waitresses who survive alone on tips. That story was published on the cover of TIME Magazine.</p>
      <p>I'm also an author. "The Emergency Teacher" -- my 1st nonfiction book was published with Random House Inc and -- investigated Philadelphia's failing public school system. "Sisters in War" -- my 2nd nonfiction book -- was drawn from years living in Baghdad, Iraq during the war.</p>

      <p> While I still love reporting and writing, I'm now building and leading organizations and  working to create the world I want my 3 daughters to live in, like Fuller Project which I built from the ground up with an amazing team starting in 2014, raised $5 million, and convinced countless newsroom editors to take seriously investigative journalism on issues impacting women. I joined Hack Club in 2020 to change our education system and create a new generation of young leaders with tech skills to build and innovate in America... </p>

         <p>Like most people, there's been lots of personal setbacks and failures along my journey. If I can help you in your journey- email me a question :). </p>
