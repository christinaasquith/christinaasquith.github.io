      <center>Hi, my name is Christina, and I'm Chief Operating Officer and board member of <a
            href=https://hackclub.com target="_blank">Hack Club,</a> and global movement of young coders who impact change through technology. We're a 501c3, founded in 2014.<br>

        <p>I'm also founder of <strong><a href=https="//fullerproject.org/"" target=" _blank">The Fuller
              Project</a></strong>, a global nonprofit journalism organization that investigates issues impacting women.
          For 7 years, I created & grew Fuller Project, leading our investigative journalism as editor-in-chief, raising
          the first $5-$7 million in donations, and building out all our media partnerships, including with The NYTimes
          Magazine, Foreign Policy Magazine, PRI's The World and TIME Magazine, for whom Fuller Project had the cover story in 2019.<br>
        </p>

        <p>I'm an entrepreneur, and before I discovered my love for start-ups, I was a journalist for 15 years, starting at NYT, and then as a staffer at The Philadelphia Inquirer and PRI's The World. At the start of the US invasion of Iraq, I snuck into Baghdad and covered the impact of war on women and girls. I've written and edited pieces for years for: The New Yorker, The Atlantic and Washington Post. My 2 nonfiction
          books are on women in the Iraq war, and as my year as a 6th grade teacher in North Philadelphia. I was born in
          NYC, but I've lived in Baghdad, Istanbul, London and Santiago, Chile. I've been interviewed on NPR, BBC, ABC
          News, Al Jazeera and PRI's The World. </p>
          <p>In my free time, I run on dirt-roads in Vermont, and invest in real estate and tech stocks. I love to code with my daughters</p> <br>
