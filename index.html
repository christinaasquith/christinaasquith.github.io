        <p><center>Hi there! My name is Christina, and I'm Chief Operating Officer and board member of <strong><a href=https://hackclub.com target="_blank">Hack Club,</a></strong> a global tech non-profit that is creating a new generation of coders and innovators.<br> 
          
          <p>I'm also founder of <strong><a href=https="//fullerproject.org/"" target="_blank">The Fuller Project</a></strong>, a global nonprofit journalism organization that investigates issues impacting women. 
           For 7 years, I grew Fuller Project, leading our investigative journalism as editor-in-chief, raising the first $5million in donations, and building out all our media partnerships, including with TIME Magazine, for whom Fuller Project had the cover story in 2019.<br></p>
          
          <p>My career includes years reporting for The New York Times, Economist, The Philadelphia Inquirer and Public Radio International, and editing pieces for The New Yorker, The Atlantic and Washington Post.  My 2 nonfiction books are on women in the Iraq war, and as my year as a 6th grade teacher in North Philadelphia. I've lived in Baghdad, Istanbul, London and Santiago, Chile. I've been interviewed on NPR, BBC, ABC News, Al Jazeera and PRI's The World. </p> <br>
