        <marquee behavior="alternate"> Hi! I'm Chief Operating Officer and board member of <b>Hack Club.</b> I'm also an investigative journalist & former war correspondent.</marquee></p>
      <p>A couple basics about me: I'm an author. "The Emergency Teacher" -- my 1st nonfiction book was published with Random House Inc and -- <b>investigated Philadelphia's failing public school system.</b> "Sisters in War" -- my 2nd nonfiction book -- was drawn from <b>years living in Baghdad, Iraq</b> during the war.  At 19 years old I began reporting for The New York Times, and over my career, I've spoken on NPR, ABC News, BBC News, Al Jazeera and reported and edited for The New Yorker, The Atlantic, The Washington Post, Associated Press, CNN,and had a column in Foreign Policy Magazine. . . Of the thousands of articles, radio segments and documentaries I've worked on, you'll find my favorite <a href="My Articles.html">here.</a>  In 2019, I came up with an idea to investigate underpaid women workers in the US, focusing on tens of thousands of US waitresses who survive alone on tips. That story was published on the cover of TIME Magazine!</p>
      <p> While I still love reporting and writing, I'm now <b>building and leading organizations and </b> working to create the world I want my daughters to live in, like Fuller Project and Hack Club...At heart, I'm a hacker-- I love taking risks, unconventional and radical solutions, and playing around, (like <b>coding this website)</b> With Hack Club, I want to help build a new generation of leaders with tech skills and a hacker mindset. </p>
